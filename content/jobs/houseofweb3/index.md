- I played a key role in developing the Airdrops feature aimed at the Web3 community. This feature is designed to drive growth and engagement by utilizing a work-to-earn mechanism. By participating in community-driven activities, users can earn rewards, enhancing their engagement and loyalty.

- To enhance the interoperability and scalability of our application, I have designed and implemented a RESTful API. This API serves as the communication backbone between various components of the application, ensuring seamless data exchange and integration
- In pursuit of operational excellence and agility, I have deployed backend applications by containerizing them using AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) and AWS Lambda. This approach leverages a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process, enhances scalability, and reduces downtime.
<!-- - Provide leadership within engineering department through close collaboration, knowledge shares, and mentorship -->
